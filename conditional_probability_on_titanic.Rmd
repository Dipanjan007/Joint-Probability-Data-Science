# The Titanic Dataset

## Import and Understand the Dataset

![Data Description](img/titanic_data_description.png)

* Read in the "titanic.csv" data file provided to you pass in the vector c(" ", "") to the na.strings argument in the read.csv() function

```{r}

titanic <- read.csv("titanic.csv", na.strings = c(" ",""))

```

__Exercise :__ Read the R help document page and understand why we need to pass in blank values("") to the na.strings argument

* Understand the structure and summary of your dataset

```{r}

head(titanic)

str(titanic)

summary(titanic)

```

## Handle Missing Values

* Look at the number of missing values column wise using the colSums() function in conjunction with the is.na() function

```{r}

colSums(is.na(titanic))

```

### Imputing Missing Values

* Today we will be using the centralImputation() function from the DMwR package to replace missing values

```{r}

library(DMwR)

titanic <- centralImputation(titanic)

colSums(is.na(titanic))

```

__Exercise :__ Read the R help document page for the centralImputation() and centralValue() functions and understand what central tendencies are used to replace missing values

* Before we proceed further let's save some useful attributes from the dataset

* In general, we will use the terms observations and rows; columns and variables interchangeably


```{r}

no_obs <- nrow(titanic)

no_vars <- ncol(titanic)

```

# Marginal Probability

* Marginal probability is a likelihood measure for a single event, irrespective of other events occuring

$$P(X = Men) = \frac{Number\ of\ Men}{Total\ Number\ of\ Observations}$$

* So, let us compute some basic marginal probabilities from the titanic dataset using the dplyr library

__1. If you pick a person aboard the titanic at random, what is the probability that he/she survived?__

```{r warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

titanic %>% 
  summarise(prob_survived = sum(Survived)/n())

```

__2. If you pick a person aboard the titanic at random, what is the probability that the person's gender is female?__

```{r}

titanic %>% 
  filter(Sex =="female") %>% 
  summarise(sum(Survived)/no_obs)

```

__3. If you pick a person aboard the titanic at random, calculate the probability that the person belongs to each of the levels in the `Embarked` column?__

```{r}

titanic %>% 
  group_by(Embarked) %>%
  summarise(prob = n() / no_obs)

```


# Joint Probability

* Joint probability is a likelihood measure useful when we are interested in the occurance of two events happening together

$$P(A,B) = P({A}\textbf{|} {B}) \times P(B)$$

![](img/joint_prob.png)

__1. If you pick a person aboard the titanic at random, what is the probability that the person is a male and also belongs to the 3rd Class (Pclass = 3)?__

```{r}

titanic %>% 
  filter(Sex == "male", Pclass==3) %>% 
  summarise(length(PassengerId)/no_obs)

```

__2. If you pick a person aboard the titanic at random, what is the probability that a first class passenger (Pclass = 1) embarked the journey from Q?__

```{r}

titanic %>%
  filter (Pclass == 1,Embarked=="Q") %>%
  summarise("prob_class1_embarked_Q" = n()/no_obs)
```

__3. If you pick a person aboard the titanic at random, what is the probability that the passenger paid less than 25$ and survived?__

```{r}

titanic %>%
  filter (Survived == 1,Fare<25) %>%
  summarise("prob_survived_paid_less_than_25$" = n()/no_obs)

```


# Conditional probability

* Conditional probability is a likelihood measure of an event occuring given that another event has occured

$$P(X\ |\ Y) = \frac{P(X, Y)}{P(Y)}$$

* Most generic conditional probability questions look like the following question :

__1. Given that a person bought a ticket of class 1 (Pclass), calculate the probability that they embarked in one of the ports?__

```{r}

pclass1_obs <- nrow(titanic %>% filter(Pclass==1))

titanic %>% 
  filter(Pclass==1) %>% 
  group_by(Embarked) %>% 
  summarise("prob_embarked_pclass1" = n()/pclass1_obs)

```

* In the real world however, the questions would sound more like the following :

__2. Mrs. Saunders boarded in S, what is the probability that she belongs to `Pclass` 1?__

```{r}

titanic %>%
  filter(Embarked == "S") %>%
  mutate(first_class_pass = ifelse(Pclass == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  summarise(prob_first_class = sum(first_class_pass) / n())

```

__3. Mr. Musk has atleast one of his siblings (SibSp) aboard the titanic, what is the pobability that Mr. Musk survived?__

```{r}

titanic %>%
  filter(SibSp >= 1)%>%
  summarise(prob=sum(Survived)/n())

```
